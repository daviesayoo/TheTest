The prompt defines
 the need for a React application with a top bar, a side menu that can be enlarged and collapsed, and two pages with distinct content and functionality. The top bar has a "Programmer" heading and a backdrop color. The side selection includes two items ("Page 1" and "Page 2") that are links with icons next to them, and it can remember the user's last option to determine if the menu is enlarged or deflated. The first page is divided into two sections, with HTML components on the left and an output window on the right. The question specifies the color scheme for each of the two themes (light and dark). When a user selects a button to change the style, The app's color scheme should be updated, and a message should be displayed in the output window. A button to adjust the theme, a text box and button for sending messages to the output window, and a button to add extra buttons to the left side of the screen are all on the left side of the screen. Page 2 is a single view with buttons in the same color scheme as Page 1. When you click the first button, a modal appears in the centre of the app display.
